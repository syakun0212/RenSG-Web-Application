## Setting up the development environment

1. Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) installed.
2. Setting up the client:

   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   Start the client with `npm run start`

3. Setting up the api server:
   ```
   cd api
   ```
   Create and start the virtual environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/Scripts/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Start the server with
   ```
   export FLASK_APP=api
   export FLASK_DEBUG=1
   flask run
   ```

## How to Use

Firstly, download [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and follow its
instructions to install it. This allows us to start using Docker containers.

Create a local copy of this repository and run

    docker-compose build

This spins up Compose and builds a local development environment according to
our specifications in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). Keep in mind that
this file contains settings for _development_, and not _production_.

After the containers have been built (this may take a few minutes), run

    docker-compose up

This one command boots up a local server for Flask (on port 5000)
and React (on port 3000). Head over to

    http://localhost:3000/

to view an incredibly underwhelming React webpage listing two fruits and their
respective prices.
Though the apparent result is underwhelming, this data was retrieved through an API call
to our Flask server, which can be accessed at

    http://localhost:5000/api/v1.0/test

The trailing '_/api/v1.0/test_' is simply for looks, and can be tweaked easily
in [api/app.py](api/app.py). The front-end logic for consuming our API is
contained in [client/src/index.js](client/src/index.js). The code contained within
these files simply exists to demonstrate how our front-end might consume our back-end
API.

Finally, to gracefully stop running our local servers, you can run

    docker-compose down

in a separate terminal window or press **control + C**.

## Update requirements.txt from conda

pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt

## To reset/clean docker containers

docker-compose down
docker ps --all
docker volume prune
rm -rf \*-data
